### SOX v2.8.0 DEV

Stack Overflow Extras (*SOX*) is a project that stemmed from the [Stack Overflow Optional Features (SOOF)](https://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Features) project.

The SOX userscript adds a bunch of **optional** features to all sites in the Stack Exchange network. These can be toggled on or off from an easy to use control panel (see screenshot below).

Note: This project has no relation to Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange; it is simply a userscript that enhances the sites!

## Installation & Requirements

1. Install a userscript manager; these are free extensions available for all popular browsers that allow you to manage and install userscripts, along with exposing certain code functions that SOX requires.

    We recommend [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) for Chrome and Firefox.

    Whilst SOX only explicitly supports Chrome and Firefox, it should work on any popular browser that can run userscripts.

    **Note: Greasemonkey 4 and upwards [is not supported with SOX](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/issues/306).**

    **There seems to be [an issue with Tampermonkey on Firefox](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey/issues/477) where userscripts don't seem to run. If this happens, please restart your browser and/or computer before raising an issue on GitHub, as a restart seems to fix this!**

2. Install the script. Clicking on 'install' below will make Tampermonkey prompt you automatically to install it.

    - Official Version: <kbd>[install](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/raw/v2.8.0/sox.user.js)</kbd>. <kbd>[view source](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/blob/v2.8.0/sox.user.js)</kbd>

3. Go to any site in the Stack Exchange Network (e.g. [Super User](http://superuser.com/) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)) (reload if already opened) and confirm the dialog asking you to get an access token. This will open a new page where you can authorize SOX, and can be closed once your access token is saved. A toggle button (gears icon) will be added to your topbar. Click and review and save the settings
